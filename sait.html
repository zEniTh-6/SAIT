            C is a procedural programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is one of the most influential languages and is often referred to as a "low-level" language due to its close relationship with machine architecture. C is designed for system-level programming, making it ideal for operating systems, embedded systems, and hardware interfacing. It offers powerful control over memory using features like pointers and direct memory manipulation, allowing programmers to optimize performance. C’s syntax is simple and minimalistic, making it efficient but also requiring careful memory management. Despite being over four decades old, C remains widely used in various domains, especially where performance and resource management are critical.

            <p class="course_info">
            C++ is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the 1980s as an extension of C. It builds upon C's procedural foundation but adds object-oriented programming (OOP) features, such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, which allow for more modular and reusable code. C++ also introduces features like templates for generic programming and exception handling for improved error management. These enhancements make C++ more suitable for large-scale applications, system software, game development, and performance-critical applications. It retains the low-level capabilities of C, allowing for fine-grained memory management and system access, making it a powerful choice for developers needing both performance and abstraction.

            <p class="course_info">
            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. It is known for its simple, readable syntax, which emphasizes code clarity and developer productivity. Python is dynamically typed and automatically manages memory, which simplifies development compared to lower-level languages like C and C++. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, making it versatile for a wide range of applications. Its extensive standard library and large ecosystem of third-party packages make it particularly popular in areas such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and scripting. Python’s ease of use and extensive community support have made it one of the most popular and accessible languages for beginners and professionals alike.
